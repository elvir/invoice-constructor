This problem does not impact ASAP because Safari 6.0 supports\n// mutation observers, so that implementation is used instead.\n// However, if we ever elect to use timers in Safari, the prevalent work-around\n// is to add a scroll event listener that calls for a flush.\n\n// `setTimeout` does not call the passed callback if the delay is less than\n// approximately 7 in web workers in Firefox 8 through 18, and sometimes not\n// even then.\n\nfunction makeRequestCallFromTimer(callback) {\n    return function requestCall() {\n        // We dispatch a timeout with a specified delay of 0 for engines that\n        // can reliably accommodate that request. This will usually be snapped\n        // to a 4 milisecond delay, but once we're flushing, there's no delay\n        // between events.\n        var timeoutHandle = setTimeout(handleTimer, 0);\n        // However, since this timer gets frequently dropped in Firefox\n        // workers, we enlist an interval handle that will try to fire\n        // an event 20 times per second until it succeeds.\n        var intervalHandle = setInterval(handleTimer, 50);\n\n        function handleTimer() {\n            // Whichever timer succeeds will cancel both timers and\n            // execute the callback.\n            clearTimeout(timeoutHandle);\n            clearInterval(intervalHandle);\n            callback();\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n// This is for `asap.js` only.\n// Its name will be periodically randomized to break any code that depends on\n// its existence.\nrawAsap.makeRequestCallFromTimer = makeRequestCallFromTimer;\n\n// ASAP was originally a nextTick shim included in Q. This was factored out\n// into this ASAP package. It was later adapted to RSVP which made further\n// amendments. These decisions, particularly to marginalize MessageChannel and\n// to capture the MutationObserver implementation in a closure, were integrated\n// back into ASAP proper.\n// https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/blob/cddf7232546a9cf858524b75cde6f9edf72620a7/lib/rsvp/asap.js\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/asap/browser-raw.js\n ** module id = 424\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\"use strict\";\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\n\nfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\nvar DragSource = (function () {\n  function DragSource() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, DragSource);\n  }\n\n  DragSource.prototype.canDrag = function canDrag() {\n    return true;\n  };\n\n  DragSource.prototype.isDragging = function isDragging(monitor, handle) {\n    return handle === monitor.getSourceId();\n  };\n\n  DragSource.prototype.endDrag = function endDrag() {};\n\n  return DragSource;\n})();\n\nexports[\"default\"] = DragSource;\nmodule.exports = exports[\"default\"];\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/dnd-core/lib/DragSource.js\n ** module id = 425\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\"use strict\";\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\n\nfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\nvar DropTarget = (function () {\n  function DropTarget() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, DropTarget);\n  }\n\n  DropTarget.prototype.canDrop = function canDrop() {\n    return true;\n  };\n\n  DropTarget.prototype.hover = function hover() {};\n\n  DropTarget.prototype.drop = function drop() {};\n\n  return DropTarget;\n})();\n\nexports[\"default\"] = DropTarget;\nmodule.exports = exports[\"default\"];\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/dnd-core/lib/DropTarget.js\n ** module id = 426\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\nexports['default'] = createBackend;\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { 'default': obj }; }\n\nfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError('Cannot call a class as a function'); } }\n\nvar _lodashNoop = require('lodash/noop');\n\nvar _lodashNoop2 = _interopRequireDefault(_lodashNoop);\n\nvar TestBackend = (function () {\n  function TestBackend(manager) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, TestBackend);\n\n    this.actions = manager.getActions();\n  }\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.setup = function setup() {\n    this.didCallSetup = true;\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.teardown = function teardown() {\n    this.didCallTeardown = true;\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.connectDragSource = function connectDragSource() {\n    return _lodashNoop2['default'];\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.connectDragPreview = function connectDragPreview() {\n    return _lodashNoop2['default'];\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.connectDropTarget = function connectDropTarget() {\n    return _lodashNoop2['default'];\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.simulateBeginDrag = function simulateBeginDrag(sourceIds, options) {\n    this.actions.beginDrag(sourceIds, options);\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.simulatePublishDragSource = function simulatePublishDragSource() {\n    this.actions.publishDragSource();\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.simulateHover = function simulateHover(targetIds, options) {\n    this.actions.hover(targetIds, options);\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.simulateDrop = function simulateDrop() {\n    this.actions.drop();\n  };\n\n  TestBackend.prototype.simulateEndDrag = function simulateEndDrag() {\n    this.actions.endDrag();\n  };\n\n  return TestBackend;\n})();\n\nfunction createBackend(manager) {\n  return new TestBackend(manager);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = exports['default'];\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/dnd-core/lib/backends/createTestBackend.js\n ** module id = 427\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\nexports['default'] = checkDecoratorArguments;\n\nfunction checkDecoratorArguments(functionName, signature) {\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len > 2 ? _len - 2 : 0), _key = 2; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key - 2] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    for (var i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {\n      var arg = args[i];\n      if (arg && arg.prototype && arg.prototype.render) {\n        console.error( // eslint-disable-line no-console\n        'You seem to be applying the arguments in the wrong order.
